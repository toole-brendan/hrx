# HandReceipt - Remaining Development Tasks

This document outlines the remaining development tasks for the HandReceipt application, organized from easiest to most complex implementation.

## ðŸŸ¢ Quick Fixes (< 30 minutes each)

### 2. Network Page Export Button
**Location:** `/web/src/pages/Connections.tsx` (line ~382)  
**Task:** Fix the "Failed to export connections" error
- The export functionality is already implemented in the backend
- Check if the `exportConnections` service function is properly handling the response
- Verify the API endpoint `/api/users/connections/export` is returning CSV data correctly
- May need to handle the file download properly in the frontend (blob response)

### 3. Dashboard Search UI Enhancement
**Location:** `/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`  
**Task:** Improve the search input styling and functionality
- Update search input to match the styling used in other pages (Network, Property Book)
- Add proper placeholder text
- Consider adding search icon inside the input
- Ensure consistent border, focus states, and hover effects
- Add loading state if search is async
- STUDY THE IOS MODULE'S SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY WHICH MIGHT BE SUPERIOR (BUT I WANT IT TO HAVE /WEB STYLING)

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Complexity (1-2 hours each)

### 4. Add Item Modal Update
**Location:** `/web/src/components/modals/AddItemModal.tsx` (or similar)  
**Task:** Complete styling overhaul and functionality review
- Update modal to match the NewTransferDialog styling pattern:
  - Header with icon and title/subtitle
  - Section dividers with centered labels
  - FormField component pattern with icons
  - Consistent button styling (blue-500)
- Review functionality:
  - Ensure form validation is working
  - Check if all required fields are present
  - Verify successful item creation flow
  - Add proper error handling and user feedback

### 5. Advanced Search Filter - Network Directory
**Location:** `/web/src/pages/Connections.tsx` (Directory tab section)  
**Task:** Implement functional advanced search filters
- The UI is already built but filters aren't being applied
- Modify the `searchUsers` API call to include filter parameters:
  - Organization/Unit filter
  - Rank filter
  - Location filter
- Update the backend `/api/users/search` endpoint to accept and process these filters
- Ensure filters are properly combined with the main search query

### 6. Update Remaining Pages for Consistency
**Pages to Update:**
- `/web/src/pages/Notifications.tsx`
- `/web/src/pages/Settings.tsx`
- `/web/src/pages/Profile.tsx`

**Tasks for each page:**
- Apply consistent header styling (gradient backgrounds, proper spacing)
- Update button colors to blue-500 scheme
- Ensure consistent card styling (CleanCard component usage)
- Add proper loading states with skeleton screens
- Update form inputs to match app-wide patterns
- Add iOS-style components where appropriate
- Ensure responsive design works properly

## ðŸ”´ Complex Features (4+ hours each)

### 7. AI Feature Integration
**Potential Features to Consider:**
- **Smart Item Description:** Use AI to generate detailed item descriptions from photos
- **Predictive Search:** AI-powered search suggestions based on user patterns
- **Automated Form Filling:** Extract information from uploaded documents using AI
- **Intelligent Notifications:** AI to prioritize and summarize notifications

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Choose appropriate AI service (OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom model)
2. Create backend API endpoints for AI features
3. Implement rate limiting and cost controls
4. Add frontend UI components for AI interactions
5. Include user preferences for AI features in Settings

### 8. Production Demo User with Full Data
**Task:** Create a comprehensive demo environment for potential users

**Backend Requirements:**
1. Create SQL migration script with demo data:
   ```sql
   -- Demo user account
   -- Sample properties with various statuses
   -- Example transfers in different states
   -- Sample connections/network
   -- Demo documents and messages
   -- Notification history
   ```

2. Add "Dev Login" button on login page that:
   - Auto-fills demo credentials
   - Shows a banner indicating demo mode
   - Potentially resets demo data periodically

3. Demo data should showcase:
   - Full property inventory with components
   - Active and completed transfers
   - Network connections
   - Unread notifications and messages
   - Various document types
   - Dashboard with meaningful statistics

**Security Considerations:**
- Ensure demo user has limited permissions
- Prevent demo user from affecting real data
- Add clear indicators throughout UI that this is demo mode
- Consider read-only mode or data reset functionality

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Notes

- All styling updates should maintain consistency with the existing design system
- Test all changes on both desktop and mobile viewports
- Ensure accessibility standards are maintained (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add proper TypeScript types where missing
- Include error handling and user feedback for all user actions
- Consider adding e2e tests for critical user flows

## ðŸš€ Recommended Order of Implementation

1. Start with quick fixes (1-3) to build momentum
2. Tackle the Add Item Modal (4) as it's a frequently used feature
3. Fix the Advanced Search (5) to complete the Network functionality
4. Update remaining pages (6) for overall consistency
5. Plan and implement AI features (7) based on user feedback
6. Create demo environment (8) once core features are polished
