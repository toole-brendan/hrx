Understood. I’ll provide line-by-line instructions to:

1. Update the iOS model to make `verificationReasons` optional so decoding doesn't fail when the key is missing.
2. Update the backend Go struct to remove `omitempty` from `verification_reasons` so the field is always included in the response (even if empty).
3. Verify that the backend always initializes `verification_reasons` to an empty slice if no reasons are detected.

These changes will ensure your Azure OCR flow is resilient on both client and server.


## 1. **iOS Module – Make `verificationReasons` Optional in AzureImportMetadata**

**File:** `ios/HandReceipt/Services/APIService.swift` (AzureImportMetadata struct definition). Locate the `AzureImportMetadata` struct (around line 1875). Change the `verificationReasons` property from a non-optional array to an optional array of strings. It is currently defined as:

```swift
public let verificationReasons: [String]    // current definition (non-optional):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
```

Update this line to:

```swift
public let verificationReasons: [String]?
```

By making this property optional (`[String]?`), the Swift JSON decoder will no longer throw a key-not-found error if the `"verification_reasons"` field is missing in the payload. The rest of the CodingKeys remain the same – it still maps to the `"verification_reasons"` JSON key, but now the app will safely handle cases where the backend omits that key.

## 2. **Go Backend – Remove `omitempty` and Initialize `VerificationReasons`**

**File:** `backend/internal/models/da2062.go` (ImportMetadata struct). In the `ImportMetadata` struct, remove the `omitempty` tag from the **VerificationReasons** field so that it is always included in JSON responses. Currently the field is defined as:

```go
VerificationReasons  []string  `json:"verification_reasons,omitempty"`  // omits field if empty:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
```

Change this to:

```go
VerificationReasons  []string  `json:"verification_reasons"`  // removed omitempty  
```

Removing `omitempty` ensures that `"verification_reasons"` will appear in the JSON output even if the slice is empty.

Next, ensure the server initializes this slice as empty (instead of `nil`) when no reasons are present, so that the JSON shows an empty array `[]` rather than `null`. In the DA-2062 batch import handler where the `ImportMetadata` is constructed, add a safeguard after populating the struct. For example, in **`backend/internal/api/handlers/da2062_handler.go`**, right after building the `importMetadata` object and adding any specific verification reasons, insert an empty-slice initialization. In the code, after the block that appends reasons for missing serial numbers (around lines 499–508), add:

```go
// Ensure VerificationReasons is not nil – initialize as empty slice if no reasons were added
if len(importMetadata.VerificationReasons) == 0 {
    importMetadata.VerificationReasons = []string{}
}
```

This should be placed before the `item := models.DA2062ImportItem{ ... ImportMetadata: &importMetadata, ... }` construction (around line 510). By doing this, even if no verification reasons were found (and thus the slice was never appended to), the field will be an empty slice instead of `nil`. With `omitempty` removed, the JSON response will include `"verification_reasons": []` for such items.

## 3. **Verify Alignment with Azure OCR Response Structure**

These changes maintain consistency with the expected Azure OCR payload structure and our app’s decoding logic. Notably, the Azure OCR API’s raw response does **not** natively provide a `"verification_reasons"` field – this field is introduced by our backend to flag missing data or low confidence items. In scenarios where Azure doesn’t identify any issues, the field might be absent or empty. Marking `verificationReasons` as optional on iOS and always returning an empty list on the backend covers both cases. The JSON key naming remains consistent: we use `"verification_reasons"` in the payload (snake\_case, as per backend struct tag), which the iOS model maps to the `verificationReasons` property via CodingKeys.

By implementing these changes, the iOS app’s decoder will handle the Azure OCR metadata robustly – if the backend omits the key or sends an empty list, the optional `[String]?` will simply be `nil` or an empty array (no crash), and if there are reasons, they will decode into the array as usual. The backend, for its part, will always include the `"verification_reasons"` field in responses (with an empty array when no reasons are present), ensuring the payload is complete and matches the app’s expectations. This alignment guarantees that our data model stays in sync with the actual OCR response content and that decoding is safe under all conditions.

**Summary of Changes:**

* *iOS (Swift)* – In `AzureImportMetadata`, change `verificationReasons` to an optional array of `String` to tolerate missing keys.
* *Backend (Go)* – In `ImportMetadata`, remove `omitempty` from the `verification_reasons` JSON tag *and* initialize the slice to `[]` if no reasons exist before returning the JSON.
* These adjustments ensure that the Azure OCR import metadata is decoded without errors and faithfully represents the Azure OCR output (with our additional verification info) in both the app and server responses.

**References:** The code snippets above are based on the `hrx` repository implementation of Azure OCR import handling, confirming that our modifications align with the intended data structures and Azure’s output format.
