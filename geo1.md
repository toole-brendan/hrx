Testing the OCR Integration End-to-End
To verify that Azure OCR is working end-to-end, consider the following approach:
API Test with a Sample Form: Use a tool like Postman or curl to call the POST /api/da2062/upload endpoint with a test file. Provide a multipart/form-data request where the field name is "file" and the value is a DA-2062 form image or PDF. (Make sure to include authentication if required – this route is under protected API routes, so you might need to log in or provide a session token as this endpoint expects an authenticated user context.) A successful response should return a JSON payload containing form_info (e.g. unit name, DODAAC, form number), an array of items (each with NSN, description, quantity, serial, etc.), and metadata like confidence scores
GitHub
. For example, you should see a response with "success": true and a list of parsed items. This will confirm that the OCR processed the document and parsed the content.
Check Logs for OCR Activity: Monitor the backend logs during the test. The code logs errors if OCR fails (e.g. “Azure OCR failed: …” in the handler)
GitHub
. If you see no errors and get a structured response, the OCR call was likely successful. In case of failure, the error message (from Azure or the handler) will be in the JSON response and logs (e.g. an HTTP error or a timeout). Common issues could be an invalid endpoint or key (resulting in 401/403 errors) or unsupported file format. Ensuring the endpoint URL and key are correct is crucial (they should match your Azure Cognitive Services instance).
Direct Azure Verification: Optionally, you can cross-verify outside the app by using Azure’s OCR service on the same sample file. For instance, use Azure’s REST API or SDK on the file to see what text is extracted, and compare it to what the app returns. This helps confirm that the app’s parsing logic aligns with Azure’s output. However, this may not be necessary if the above API test returns expected data.
After running a successful test, you’ll know the Azure OCR integration is functioning. The JSON response will indicate recognized text and items. For example, the items array will contain entries derived from the form’s lines, and the confidence values will tell you how certain the OCR was for each item. If the RequiresVerification flag in the response metadata is true (or if some items have low confidence/”verificationReasons”), it means the system flagged some data that might need human review – you can use this in your verification step.
Next Steps and Recommendations
With Azure OCR now implemented, here are some next steps to consider:
Thorough Testing and Tuning: It’s important to test the OCR with real-world examples of DA-2062 forms, especially handwritten ones. Evaluate how well the current parsing logic extracts fields. If certain fields (like serial numbers or NSNs) aren’t being recognized or parsed correctly, you may need to refine the regex patterns or parsing rules. For instance, the current parser looks for patterns like a 13-digit NSN or lines starting with a number to identify new items
GitHub
, and it tries to grab serial numbers from continuation lines
GitHub
. If the forms vary in format or handwriting quality, be prepared to adjust these rules or add post-processing (e.g. normalizing OCR text, handling common OCR errors like O vs 0). Ensuring high accuracy in DA2062ParsedForm will reduce the manual correction needed later.
Verification Workflow: The system marks certain items or forms as requiring verification if confidence is low
GitHub
 or if specific fields are uncertain. You should verify that the verification process is in place. In the code, after OCR, the response includes next_steps.verification_needed and each item has an ImportMetadata.RequiresVerification flag
GitHub
GitHub
. The frontend or user should review those items. Implement or test the “Verify Imported Item” route (PUT /api/da2062/verify/:id) if it exists, to allow confirming or correcting OCR results. This might involve updating serial numbers or other fields that were low confidence. Make sure this route updates the item and possibly logs the verification event to the ledger (the code indicates a call to log verification in the ledger
GitHub
).
Batch Insertion to Inventory (Immudb Logging): Once the OCR output is verified, the next step is to insert the items into the permanent inventory and ledger. The code provides a POST /api/inventory/batch endpoint (BatchCreateInventory) that takes a list of DA2062ImportItem and creates actual property records
GitHub
GitHub
. You should use this after verification to add the OCR-parsed items to the database. Confirm that this process works: the handler will likely transform the import items into domain.Property objects and save them via the repository, then log the event to Immudb. Indeed, the handler logs a “DA2062 Batch Import” event to the ledger for traceability
GitHub
. Verify that Immudb (the ledger service) is running and that these events appear, ensuring end-to-end immutability of the record creation. If not already done, you might need to implement the actual insertion of properties in the repository if the current code left any TODOs.
Docker/Deployment Update: As a next operational step, make sure your deployment pipeline is updated to include the Azure OCR. This means updating any CI/CD or deployment scripts to set the Azure OCR endpoint and key in the environment. If you migrated from AWS Lightsail to Azure, ensure the new Azure Container setup has those configurations (possibly via Azure Key Vault as secrets, as hinted in your container app YAML). After deploying, monitor the application in production: check logs for any OCR errors, and perhaps track Azure OCR service usage (to avoid hitting any rate limits or to estimate cost).
Enhance User Feedback: Consider providing users feedback during the OCR process, since it can take a few seconds for the OCR to complete (the code waits up to ~60 seconds). The current implementation is synchronous (the client waits for the response). If this becomes too slow for large documents, you might eventually implement an asynchronous workflow (e.g. upload returns a job ID and you poll for result). For now, ensure the client-side has a loading indicator and maybe a timeout warning if needed.
Extend OCR to Other Forms or Uses: If the DA-2062 form OCR is successful, you might plan to extend similar OCR capabilities to other document types. The AzureOCRService can be reused for other structured forms or general image text extraction. Keep the code modular for future expansion (it’s already separated in a service, which is good).
