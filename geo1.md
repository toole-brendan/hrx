Thanks. I’ll investigate both the iOS and backend code in the `hrx` repo to determine why the Azure OCR decoding fails. I’ll verify whether the Swift decoder expects `import_metadata` to always be present and if the backend's Azure OCR JSON response structure ever omits it. I’ll identify mismatches between the expected schema and actual response, and suggest how to fix the decoding failure or make the API/decoder more resilient.


# Diagnosing Azure OCR Response Decoding Failure (iOS vs. Backend Schema Mismatch)

## iOS Decoding Model Expectations

On the iOS side, the app defines a data model for the Azure OCR import response using Swift `Codable` structures. In this model, each OCR item includes an `importMetadata` field **as a non-optional property**, meaning the JSON must always contain this key for decoding to succeed. For example, the `AzureOCRItem` struct in Swift is defined as:

```swift
public struct AzureOCRItem: Codable {
    public let name: String  
    public let description: String  
    public let nsn: String?  
    public let serialNumber: String?  
    public let quantity: Int  
    public let unit: String?  
    public let category: String?  
    public let sourceRef: String?  
    public let importMetadata: AzureImportMetadata  // non-optional
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case name, description, nsn  
        case serialNumber = "serial_number"  
        case quantity, unit, category  
        case sourceRef = "source_ref"  
        case importMetadata = "import_metadata"  
    }
}
```

In this model, `importMetadata` is a required nested object (of type `AzureImportMetadata`), not an optional. The Swift decoder will **fail** if `import_metadata` is missing from any item in the JSON payload. Similarly, many fields inside `AzureImportMetadata` are defined as non-optional to match expected response keys. For instance, `verificationReasons` is defined as a non-optional array of strings (`[String]`), not a `Optional` type:

```swift
public struct AzureImportMetadata: Codable {
    public let source: String  
    public let importDate: Date?        // optional (date parsing)  
    public let formNumber: String       // non-optional  
    public let scanConfidence: Double   // non-optional  
    public let itemConfidence: Double?  // optional  
    public let serialSource: String     // non-optional  
    public let originalQuantity: Int    // non-optional  
    public let requiresVerification: Bool         // non-optional  
    public let verificationReasons: [String]      // non-optional array  
    public let sourceDocumentUrl: String?         // optional  
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey { … }
}
```

Because properties like `formNumber`, `originalQuantity`, `requiresVerification`, and `verificationReasons` are non-optional here, the decoder expects the JSON to always include these keys (even if their values are empty or false). Any missing required key will trigger a decoding error.

Notably, the iOS JSON decoder is configured with a `.convertFromSnakeCase` strategy. This means keys like `import_metadata` or `verification_reasons` in JSON are automatically mapped to `importMetadata` and `verificationReasons` in the Swift structs without needing explicit coding keys for those top-level objects. In summary, **the iOS app assumes that every item’s JSON will include an `import_metadata` object and all its expected sub-fields (or at least default values for them)**.

## Backend Azure OCR Response Structure

On the backend, the Azure OCR upload endpoint (`POST /api/da2062/upload`) processes an uploaded form image and returns a JSON payload containing the parsed items and metadata. The server constructs this response in the `DA2062Handler.respondWithParsedForm` function. Critically, for each parsed OCR item, the backend creates an `ImportMetadata` struct and attaches it to the item before appending to the result list:

```go
// Pseudocode from respondWithParsedForm
for each ocrItem in parsedForm.Items {
    importMetadata := models.ImportMetadata{ ... }
    // populate importMetadata fields (source, formNumber, confidence, etc.)
    item := models.DA2062ImportItem{
        Name:           ocrItem.ItemDescription,
        Description:    ocrItem.ItemDescription,
        SerialNumber:   serialNumber,     // trimmed OCR serial or ""
        NSN:            ocrItem.NSN,      // or "" if none
        Quantity:       ocrItem.Quantity, // default 1 if not found
        SourceRef:      parsedForm.FormNumber,
        ImportMetadata: &importMetadata,  // attach metadata pointer
    }
    items = append(items, item)
}
```

In the Go `DA2062ImportItem` definition, the `ImportMetadata` field is a pointer marked with `omitempty` in JSON tags. This means if the pointer is `nil` the `import_metadata` key would be omitted in the output. **However, as shown above, the code always sets this pointer to a real `ImportMetadata` struct for every item** (unless an item is skipped entirely for being invalid). Thus, under normal conditions, **every item in the `items` array will include an `import_metadata` object in the JSON**. The backend does not intentionally leave out the `import_metadata` key for any returned item – it is always present as long as the item itself is included.

That said, within the `ImportMetadata` object, some fields have `omitempty` tags and might be omitted if they are zero-valued. The `ImportMetadata` struct is defined (in `backend/internal/models/da2062.go`) as follows:

```go
type ImportMetadata struct {
    Source               string    `json:"source"`  
    ImportDate           time.Time `json:"import_date"`  
    FormNumber           string    `json:"form_number,omitempty"`  
    UnitName             string    `json:"unit_name,omitempty"`  
    ScanConfidence       float64   `json:"scan_confidence"`  
    ItemConfidence       float64   `json:"item_confidence"`  
    SerialSource         string    `json:"serial_source"`  
    OriginalQuantity     int       `json:"original_quantity,omitempty"`  
    QuantityIndex        int       `json:"quantity_index,omitempty"`  
    RequiresVerification bool      `json:"requires_verification"`  
    VerificationReasons  []string  `json:"verification_reasons,omitempty"`  
    SourceDocumentURL    string    `json:"source_document_url,omitempty"`  
}
```

Notice the `omitempty` tags on certain fields – for example, `form_number`, `unit_name`, `original_quantity`, `quantity_index`, and `verification_reasons`. If these fields are empty/zero, they will **not appear in the JSON**. The backend code populates many of these fields based on OCR results:

* `Source` is set to `"azure_ocr"` (always present).
* `FormNumber` is set to the parsed or generated form identifier (always non-empty, since the code generates a default if none is found).
* `ScanConfidence` comes from the OCR item’s confidence (always set, default \~0.8 if not calculated).
* `SerialSource` is derived (e.g., `"ocr_explicit"`, `"ocr_inferred"`, or `"none"`) based on whether a serial number was detected.
* `OriginalQuantity` is set to the quantity found (defaults to 1 if not detected) and thus usually non-zero.
* `RequiresVerification` is a boolean (always present in JSON, even if `false`) indicating if the item needs manual review.
* **`VerificationReasons`** is a list of strings explaining why verification is needed. The code appends to this slice for certain conditions (e.g., missing NSN or description). If no verification issues are detected, this slice remains empty/nil.

Crucially, if `VerificationReasons` ends up empty, the `verification_reasons` key will be omitted from the JSON due to `omitempty`. Likewise, other optional fields like `unit_name` (not used in OCR import) or `quantity_index` (unused here) might not appear at all.

## Schema Mismatch and Decoding Failure

The decoding failure on iOS is happening because the **actual JSON from the backend doesn’t perfectly match the Swift `Codable` expectations**. In particular, the **iOS decoder is likely encountering a missing key for a non-optional property**, causing a `.keyNotFound` decoding error.

From the analysis above, the most probable culprit is the `verification_reasons` field inside `import_metadata`. The Swift model requires `verificationReasons: [String]` for every item, but the backend **omits** `verification_reasons` when there are no reasons to report. In a successful OCR of a clean form, many items might not require verification, yielding an empty reasons list. The backend would then send JSON like:

```json
{
  "name": "ITEM NAME",
  "description": "ITEM NAME",
  "nsn": "1234-56-789-0123",
  "serial_number": "ABC123",
  "quantity": 1,
  "unit": "", 
  "category": "",
  "source_ref": "DA2062-...",
  "import_metadata": {
    "source": "azure_ocr",
    "import_date": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",       // default time if not set
    "form_number": "DA2062-...",
    "scan_confidence": 0.85,
    "item_confidence": 0.0,
    "serial_source": "ocr_explicit",
    "original_quantity": 1,
    "requires_verification": false,
    // "verification_reasons": [...]  <--- **omitted because empty** 
    "source_document_url": "/storage/da2062-scans/..."
  }
}
```

When the iOS app tries to decode this item, it will not find a `verification_reasons` key under `import_metadata`. Since `AzureImportMetadata.verificationReasons` is not optional in Swift, the decoding process will throw an error (the app’s debug logs confirm it “Failed to decode Azure OCR response”). In essence, the **schema mismatch is that the backend treats some fields as optional/omittable, while the iOS client expects them to always be present**.

Other fields could potentially cause similar issues if omitted or if types don’t align:

* **`verification_reasons`** – as discussed, missing key causes failure.
* **`form_number`** – iOS expects a `String`. The backend includes this key if parsed or even generates a default form ID, so it’s usually present. (If it were omitted, that would also break decoding, but in this case the backend always provides a form number.)
* **`original_quantity`** – iOS expects an `Int`. The backend sets this to the item’s quantity (default 1 if not found), so it should be non-zero and included for virtually all items. No issue here unless a quantity somehow came through as 0 and got omitted (the parsing code avoids 0 by defaulting to 1).
* **`import_date`** – iOS expects a `Date?`. The backend’s `ImportDate` field is not marked optional, so even if not set it shows up as a timestamp (likely `"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"`). The iOS custom date decoder can handle standard ISO8601 timestamps, so this probably parses to a Date (year 0001) rather than causing a crash.
* **`unit` and `category`** – iOS marks these as `String?`. The backend sends them as empty strings if not populated (they are not omitted in JSON). An empty string will decode into a non-nil optional (which is fine). No type mismatch here.
* **`items` array** – The entire `items` list is optional in `AzureOCRResponse` (noted “Made optional to handle null from API”). In a normal successful response, `items` will be an array (possibly empty). The only time it might be `null` is if the backend explicitly returned `items: null` or omitted it. The code shows that if no items are found, the Go slice could be `nil`, which JSON encodes as `null`. The iOS optional handles that gracefully. So this is by design and not the source of the failure (the failure occurred even though Azure OCR did return items, indicating a deeper key issue within items).

In summary, **the decoding failure stems from a **missing key** in the JSON for a field that the Swift model treats as non-optional**. The prime suspect is `verification_reasons` within `import_metadata` (and possibly any similar field with `omitempty`). Essentially, the backend’s flexibility (omitting empty fields) is at odds with the iOS client’s strict expectations.

## Resolving the Issue

To fix this compatibility issue, we have two approaches: adjust the iOS decoding model to be more lenient, or adjust the backend response to always include expected keys.

**1. Update the iOS Decoding Logic:**
Modify the Swift models so that fields which might not always appear are marked as optional or given default values. For example, changing the definition of `verificationReasons` to `public let verificationReasons: [String]?` (an optional array) would allow the decoder to treat a missing `verification_reasons` key as simply `nil` (or you could provide a default empty array in a custom initializer). Similarly, if there were any other fields prone to omission, mark them optional. In this case, `importMetadata` itself could remain non-optional (since the backend always sends it), but within `AzureImportMetadata` the `verificationReasons` should be optional or have a default. This change ensures that the decoder doesn’t throw an error when the key is absent – instead, e.g. `item.importMetadata.verificationReasons` would simply be `nil` or an empty list when no reasons were provided. The app can handle that as “no verification issues” without failing.

**2. Update the Backend Response:**
Alter the server-side JSON formatting so that required keys are never omitted. The goal is to make the JSON schema strictly match what the iOS client expects. Concretely, the backend could ensure `verification_reasons` is always present by sending an empty array when there are no reasons. This could be done by removing the `omitempty` tag on `VerificationReasons` in the `ImportMetadata` struct (so an empty slice serializes as `[]` instead of disappearing). Another option is to initialize `VerificationReasons` to an empty slice (`[]string{}`) instead of leaving it `nil` when no reasons are added – however, even an empty slice with `omitempty` will be omitted (since length 0 is considered empty), so removing `omitempty` is the more reliable fix. Similarly, if there were any chance that `form_number` or `original_quantity` could be empty/zero in some edge case, we’d ensure those keys still appear (perhaps by not using `omitempty`, or by setting a default non-empty value as is already done for form number). Ensuring the backend always returns **`"verification_reasons": []`** (at minimum) in every item’s `import_metadata` will satisfy the Swift decoder’s requirement for that key, even if it’s just an empty list.

In this scenario, the quickest remedy is likely on the **iOS side** – marking the problematic field optional – because it requires only a client update and handles any current or future omissions gracefully. The client already made the entire `items` array optional to handle `null` cases, so making sub-fields optional is consistent with that defensive approach. On the other hand, fixing the **backend** to always include the field can be seen as making the API more explicit and self-consistent (clients won’t have to guess defaults for missing keys). In the long run, you might implement both: have the backend include `verification_reasons: []` when no reasons exist **and** treat it as optional on iOS for robustness.

**Recommended action:** Update the iOS model for `AzureImportMetadata` to make `verificationReasons` an optional property (or provide a default empty array during decoding). This change will immediately resolve the crash on decoding. In parallel, consider adjusting the server to always return an empty array for `verification_reasons` so that future clients (or other platforms) don’t encounter the same issue. By aligning the backend JSON schema with the Swift model – or vice versa – we ensure that the Azure OCR import feature works reliably without runtime decoding errors.
