# DA2062 Export Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the complete "Export DA 2062" feature as outlined in geo1.md and geo2.md, making it fully functional with three export options: Download/Share, Email, and Send to User (in-app delivery).

## Changes Made

### iOS Frontend Implementation

#### 1. MyPropertiesView.swift
- **Added onDismiss handler** to the `.fullScreenCover` for DA2062ExportView
- **Automatically exits selection mode** and clears selected items when the export modal closes
- **Ensures clean UI state** after export operations

#### 2. DA2062ExportView.swift
- **Added Unit Info Editor functionality**:
  - New state variables: `showingUnitInfoEditor`, `showingRecipientPicker`, `selectedConnection`
  - Unit info "Edit" button now opens a form sheet for editing unit details
  - Users can modify unit name, DODAAC, stock number, and location

- **Added "Send to User" functionality**:
  - New button with `person.2.arrow.trianglepath` SF Symbol
  - Integrates with ConnectionsViewModel to load user's connections
  - Recipient picker sheet with connection selection
  - Sends hand receipt directly to another user's document inbox

- **Created UnitInfoEditorView**:
  - Form-based editor for unit information
  - Bound to view model's unit info with real-time updates
  - Save/Cancel buttons for user control

#### 3. DA2062ExportViewModel.swift
- **Enhanced GeneratePDFRequest model**:
  - Added `toUserId` field to support recipient targeting
  - Updated all PDF generation methods to include this field

- **Added sendHandReceipt(to:) method**:
  - Handles in-app delivery to specific user
  - Creates API request with recipient user ID
  - Calls new backend endpoint for document creation

- **Fixed API response parsing**:
  - Added PropertiesResponse struct to handle backend's wrapped response format
  - Updated getUserProperties() to decode `{"properties": [...]}` instead of direct array
  - Added user ID filtering to only fetch current user's properties

### Backend Implementation

#### 4. da2062_handler.go
- **Enhanced GenerateDA2062PDF endpoint**:
  - Added in-app delivery logic when `req.ToUserID != 0`
  - Verifies recipient is in sender's connections for security
  - Uploads generated PDF to storage service
  - Creates Document record for recipient's inbox
  - Returns 201 Created with document details for in-app sends

- **Added connection verification**:
  - Uses `CheckUserConnection` to ensure recipient is in sender's connections
  - Prevents sending hand receipts to arbitrary users

- **Document creation process**:
  - Creates document with type "transfer_form" and subtype "DA2062"
  - Stores PDF URL in attachments field
  - Sets status to "unread" for recipient notification
  - Logs export action to ledger for audit trail

- **Response handling**:
  - Returns appropriate status codes (200 for download, 201 for in-app delivery)
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing email functionality

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Unit Information Management

- ✅ Persistent storage in UserDefaults
- ✅ Real-time updates in export form

### 2. Property Selection

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Enhanced
- `POST /api/da2062/generate-pdf` - Enhanced to handle in-app delivery

### Data Models
- Enhanced `GeneratePDFRequest` with `toUserId` field
- Added `PropertiesResponse` for proper API response parsing
- Reused existing `Document` model for in-app delivery

- ✅ API response format mismatch resolved
- ✅ User authentication validation
- ✅ Connection verification errors
- ✅ PDF generation and storage errors

## Testing Readiness
The implementation is now ready for testing with:
- Mock users from `015_seed_test_user_mock_data.sql`
- Existing user connections for in-app delivery testing
- All three export paths (Download, Email, Send to User)

## Compliance
- Maintains DA Form 2062 official format
- Includes proper audit logging
- Implements security best practices
- Follows existing application patterns and architecture
